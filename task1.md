React

React was written by Facebook with app speed and performance in mind. It is the most popular of the main 3. If you want to create a scalable web application that uses cutting edge tech, React is the best choice.

Pros:

-   On an upward trend of popularity, which makes it easier to bring on new developers

-   Code is very easy to read, which makes handovers more smooth

-   Easy to write tests

-   Easy to use in combination with other frameworks or libraries

Cons:

-   Has a steep learning curve, can be hard to pick up for new developers.

-   As it is a library and not a framework, it does have limitations. There are some things that other frameworks can do that React cannot.

Vue

Vue was written by a former developer at Google Creative Lab, where quick prototyping is paramount. If you are looking to quickly put an idea onto your screen, Vue is ideal, though it can also be used to create bigger applications.

Pros:

-   Simple and quick to get the basics of an app together, which makes it great for smaller projects

-   Compact, making it the fastest out of the 3

-   Very easy to pick up at a basic level, partly due to the fantastic documentation and low complexity

Cons:

-   Crowdfunded, so doesn't have the same level of developer support as the other frameworks.

-   Lack of scalability can cause issues with bigger projects

Angular

Angular has been around the longest out of the 3 which works for and against it. If you want a consistent, easily maintainable system on a framework that has stood the test of time, Angular is for you.

Pros:

-   Angular apps are extremely easy to maintain, when you upgrade to a new version all of your related packages are updated automatically saving you the headache

-   The code is very consistent, making developers more productive as parts are easy to re use. This allows for new developers to easily slot into an on-going project.

-   The type system allows for developers to catch critical bugs earlier, rather than wasting time down the line backtracking to solve the problem.

Cons:

-   Now in "support mode" which means new features are no longer being added, the framework is just being maintained

-   Has poor app performance when compared to its competitors

-   Due to the complexity of the framework, it has a steep learning curve

jQuery

jQuery strongly differs from the other 3 mentioned frameworks/libraries as rather than being a full framework to build an application on, it's more of a small library that makes it quicker and easier to write snippets of code.

Pros:

-   Very easy to learn, anyone with a strong foundational knowledge of coding can pick it up in less than a day

-   Flexible, you can use jQuery in combination with almost any library or plugin as it has almost no restrictions

-   Open source, which allows it to grow faster than the the others, with community contribution

Cons:

-   Being open source means there is no particular standard that any code has to meet.
-   Much more limited than the other libraries, it is difficult to build a scalable app on jQuery only
